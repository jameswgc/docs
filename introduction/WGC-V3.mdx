WGC V3 launched on Saturday 5th April 2025 with a direct 1:1 airdrop to all wallets holding 1000+ of the old WGC V2 token ($0.09+ value at the time).

## What Makes WGC Different?

• Omnichain-native — WGC features LayerZero OFT and Superchain ERC-20 functionality, enabling native transfers across 30+ blockchains including Base, HyperEVM, ZKsync and more.

• Deflationary supply — Total supply reduced to 4 billion WGC in November 2025, with buyback and burns implemented on Base and HyperEVM.

• Permissionless utility — Anyone can build with, trade, or provide liquidity for WGC — no central entity controls how or where it can be used.

• Early-stage opportunity — Early adopters have the chance to participate from the ground up: launching markets, building integrations, or helping shape the protocol.

## What WGC V3 Enables

WGC V3 is designed to move freely between networks, enabling frictionless use across diverse ecosystems — from trading and integrations to liquidity provisioning.

It functions as a **cross-network currency layer**, combining accessibility with a scalable, future-proof architecture.

### **Omnichain Architecture**
- Built using **LayerZero OFT** + **Superchain ERC-20**  
- Fully fungible across 25+ networks  
- Uses **native burn-and-mint**, not wrapped tokens  
- Unified supply across all chains
