## What is Wild Goat Coin?

Wild Goat Coin (WGC) is an internet-native memecoin evolved into a decentralized, peer-to-peer currency protocol.

Permissionless, omnichain, and community-driven — WGC is a digital asset that can move freely across dozens of blockchain ecosystems. Its value isn't tied to fiat currencies, nor is it backed by institutions, foundations, or corporate entities.

WGC's supply, liquidity, and cross-chain architecture are engineered to operate without central control.

## Why WGC?

Bitcoin proved that alternative currency systems can thrive without centralized control, but its lack of native interoperability limits its usability across Web3.

Stablecoins have demonstrated how digital assets can achieve widespread utility across networks but are typically dependent on centralized issuers and custodial backing.

WGC builds on the strengths of both models — combining the scarcity and ethos of decentralized currency with the flexibility and cross-chain mobility of modern crypto infrastructure.


## What Makes WGC Different?

• Omnichain-native — WGC features LayerZero OFT and Superchain ERC-20 functionality, enabling native transfers across 30+ blockchains including Base, HyperEVM, ZKsync and more.

• Deflationary supply — Total supply reduced to 4 billion WGC in November 2025, with buyback and burns implemented on Base and HyperEVM.

• Permissionless utility — Anyone can build with, trade, or provide liquidity for WGC — no central entity controls how or where it can be used.

• Early-stage opportunity — Early adopters have the chance to participate from the ground up: launching markets, building integrations, or helping shape the protocol.
