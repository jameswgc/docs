### What is Dynamic?

Dynamic combines authentication, smart wallets, and secure key management into one flexible SDK. Get the most multi-chain coverage across chains and third-party wallets.

### Using Documentation

When on a single page, you'll also see a menu on the very right hand side which will list the contents of that page so you can easily navigate to the section you're looking for. Check the right hand side of this page for an example!
