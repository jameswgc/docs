### What is Wild Goat Coin?

Wild Goat Coin (WGC) is an internet-native memecoin evolving into a decentralized, alternative currency protocol.

Permissionless, omnichain, and community-driven — WGC is a digital asset that can move freely as a currency across dozens of blockchain ecosystems. Its not pegged to any fiat currency, nor is it backed by institutions, foundations, or corporate entities.

WGC's supply, liquidity, and cross-chain architecture are engineered to operate without central control.

### Why WGC?

Bitcoin proved that alternative currency systems can thrive without centralized control — but its lack of native interoperability limits its usability across Web3.

Stablecoins have demonstrated how digital assets can achieve widespread utility across networks, but they rely on centralized issuers and custodial backing.

WGC builds on the strengths of both models — combining the scarcity and ethos of decentralized currency with the flexibility and cross-chain mobility of modern crypto infrastructure.


### What Makes WGC Different?

• Omnichain-native — Built using LayerZero OFT and Superchain ERC-20 standards, enabling native transfers across 25+ blockchains including Ethereum, Solana, Base, Polygon, and more.

• Deflationary supply — Total supply capped at 5 billion WGC, minted at genesis on Ethereum.

• Permissionless utility — Anyone can build with, trade, or provide liquidity for WGC — no central entity controls how or where it can be used.

• Early-stage opportunity — Early adopters have the chance to participate from the ground up: launching markets, building integrations, or helping shape the protocol.
