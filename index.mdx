## What is Wild Goat Coin?

Wild Goat Coin (WGC) is an internet-native memecoin evolved into a decentralized, peer-to-peer currency protocol.

Permissionless, omnichain cryptocurrency — WGC is a digital asset that can move freely across dozens of blockchain ecosystems. Its value isn't tied to fiat currencies, nor is it backed by institutions, foundations, or corporate entities.

WGC's supply, liquidity, and cross-chain architecture are engineered to operate without central control.

## Why WGC?

Bitcoin proved that alternative currency systems can thrive without centralized control, but its lack of native interoperability limits its usability across Web3.

Stablecoins have demonstrated how digital assets can achieve widespread utility across networks but are typically dependent on centralized issuers and custodial backing.

WGC builds on the strengths of both models — combining the scarcity and ethos of decentralized currency with the flexibility and cross-chain mobility of modern crypto infrastructure.

## Features

On most supported chains:

- Finality in **under 1 second**  
- Fees typically **under $0.01**

Natively interoperable and fully fungible across 36+ leading blockchains
